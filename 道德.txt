When conducting a study, careful consideration must be given to who the potential participants are and how to recruit them. This is particularly important when potentially vulnerable participants will be involved in the study, as there is a need to ensure that their rights and welfare are protected.

In order to determine who is a potential participant in a study to design a sleep diary app, it is necessary to carefully consider the research question and the purpose of the study. Specific characteristics and characteristics of the study population should be selected to ensure that they are representative of the group of interest and that the findings are generalizable to that group. For example, people who need a sleep journal to improve their sleep quality and people who suffer from insomnia might be interviewed.

It is important to consider carefully the need for and inclusiveness of potentially vulnerable participants in the research, as there is a need to ensure that their rights and welfare are protected. If potentially vulnerable participants will be involved in the study, it is important to carefully consider the risks and benefits of the study for this group and to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect their rights and wellbeing.

There may be several reasons why it is necessary to include potentially vulnerable participants in research on sleep diary applications. For example, research questions may need to include specific populations, such as individuals with specific medical conditions or individuals who are experiencing sleep-related problems. In such cases, it may be necessary to include potentially vulnerable participants to ensure that the findings are relevant and generalisable to that group.

In addition, including potentially vulnerable participants in the study may provide an opportunity to address any specific needs or challenges that the group may be facing. 
If potentially vulnerable participants are to participate in research, the risks and benefits of the research to this group must be carefully considered and appropriate safeguards are in place to protect their rights and welfare. This may include providing additional support and resources to participants, obtaining informed consent from participants, and respecting their right to withdraw from the study at any time.
